# Machine-Learning-Algorithms
This file contains some Machine Learning Algorithms that are used widely in Data Science. 
Algorithm Used:
1). Logistic Regression
2). KNN
3). GNB (Gaussian Naive Bayes)
4). Random Forest
5). Decision Tree
and many more...
NLTK (Natural Language ToolKit) libraries are used to clean the tweets more.
Also at last Ensemble Learning is used with the help of VotingClassifier.
Hope this helps you!
